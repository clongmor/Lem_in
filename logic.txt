lem_in

Of course, your algorithm must render within a reasonable time, even in a case with
4000 rooms. 2 or 3 seconds is great, 9 seconds is mediocre, 15 seconds is too much.
as well as read and write must be fast.

allowed functions(unless bonus):
malloc, free, read, write, 
strerror(takes in errno and returns error message assosc), 
perror (takes in string to print before errno message and prints both), 
exit

< int max/min don't error out for coords, but do error out for ants numbers.

memory leaks

If there isnâ€™t enough data to process normally you must display ERROR
therefore, we can display other things as long as it says error too. (i think)

memory leaks:
error maps to all be checked. need to figure out the leak with get next line as soon as an incorrect amount of ants is passed.
